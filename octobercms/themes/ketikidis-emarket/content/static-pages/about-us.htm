<h2>Replacement of Damaged of Defective Items</h2>

<p>If you received a defective item that is sold by Bangoe.com and need to replace it with the same item, visit our <a href=\"https://www.bangoe.com/contact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Returns Center</a> to request a replacement. Items that are fulfilled by Bangoe.com can't be replaced, but may be returned.</p>

<h2>Using our Return Mailing Label</h2>

<p>The return mailing labels obtained from the Bangoe.com <a href=\"https://www.bangoe.com/contact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Returns Center</a> are valid only for returns shipped within Southern Africa. However, you can still use the Returns Center for items shipped from Bangoe.com to outside of Southern Africa.</p>

<p>Each return mailing label is coded for a specific shipment. Please do not include items from other orders, or other shipments from the same order, in the same box, or you will not receive the correct refund. Each shipment must be returned using a separate mailing label.</p>

<p>If you use this mailing label and the return is a result of our error (you received an incorrect or defective item, etc.), we'll pay the return shipping costs.</p>

<p>If you use this mailing label and your return is not the result of our error, the shipping cost of that returned item will be deducted from your refund. The amount deducted will be the equivalent to our standard shipping costs for that item.</p>

<h2>Returning a Gift</h2>

<p>Gift returns are confidential. The <a href=\"https://www.bangoe.com/contact\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Returns Center</a> allows gift recipients and gift givers to return items fulfilled by Bangoe.com, even if the order wasn't marked as a gift when it was purchased. The type of refund or credit you receive depends on how the gift was purchased and how it's returned.</p>

<p>Once your return is processed, we'll send an Bangoe.com Gift Card in the amount of the returned item(s) to the email address you enter on the Returns Center form. If you're the gift giver, you'll receive a refund to the original payment method. You'll need the order number to complete the returns process; this can be found on the packing slip. If you don't have an order number, please contact us.</p>
